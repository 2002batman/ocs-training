# ocs-training

This repository contains hands-on workshops for both system administrators and application developers interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage (OCS)

In [ocp4ocs4](/tree/master/ocp4ocs4) you will find the new workshop that leverages the OCS operator.

In [ocp4rook](/tree/master/ocp4rook) you will find the old workshop which uses upstream Rook to provision a Ceph-based storage backend.
