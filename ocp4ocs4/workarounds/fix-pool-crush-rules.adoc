.Fix `noobaa-core-0` stuck in `Pending` state
****

If you observe the following:

- The `noobaa-core-0` pod is stuck in `Pending`
  * If you do `oc describe po noobaa-core-0 -n openshift-storage` it is waiting to get its PVC bound
- RWO PVCs cannot be generated with the rbd-based storage class
- The Rook toolbox shows in `ceph status` that 64 pgs are stuck in "unknown" state

This can be resolved by setting all pool crush rules to the default crush rule:

- Enter the Rook toolbox
- Execute this: 
  `ceph osd lspools | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -n1 -t -I {} ceph osd pool set {} crush_rule replicated_rule`
- Still inside the toolbox: `watch ceph status` and check that the pgs all become active+clean
