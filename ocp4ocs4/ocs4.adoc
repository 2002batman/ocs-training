= Lab: Deploying and Managing OpenShift Container Storage with Rook-Ceph Operator

== Lab Overview

This hands-on workshop is for both system administrators and application developers interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). In this lab you will be using OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x and the OCS operator to deploy Ceph and the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG) as a persistent storage solution for OCP workloads.

=== In this lab you will learn how to

* Configure and deploy containerized Ceph and Noobaa
* Validate deployment of containerized Ceph Luminous and Noobbaa
* Deploy the Rook toolbox to run Ceph and RADOS commands
* Creating a Read-Write-Once (RWO) PVC that is based on Ceph RBDs
* Creating a Read-Write-Many (RWX) PVC that is based on CephFS
* Using the Noobaa console to generate a bucket that is replicated on multiple endpoints
// * Upgrade Ceph version from Mimic to Nautilus using the Rook operator
// * Add more storage to the Ceph cluster

=== Scale OCP cluster and add two new worker nodes

In this section, you will validate the OCP environment has three master and two worker nodes before adding two more worker nodes. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes
----
----
NAME                                            STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-134-228.eu-central-1.compute.internal   Ready    master   51m   v1.14.6+d3a139f63
ip-10-0-139-194.eu-central-1.compute.internal   Ready    worker   46m   v1.14.6+d3a139f63
ip-10-0-153-8.eu-central-1.compute.internal     Ready    master   51m   v1.14.6+d3a139f63
ip-10-0-157-160.eu-central-1.compute.internal   Ready    worker   46m   v1.14.6+d3a139f63
ip-10-0-174-74.eu-central-1.compute.internal    Ready    master   51m   v1.14.6+d3a139f63
----

Now you are going to add two more OCP worker nodes to the cluster by scaling the appropriate *machinesets*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----

This will show you the existing *machinesets* used to create the two worker nodes that are in the cluster already. There is a *machineset* for each AWS availability zone (AZ) (eu-central-1a, eu-central-1b, eu-central-1c). Your *machinesets* `NAME` will be different than below. 

----
NAME                                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1a   1         1         1       1           53m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1b   1         1         1       1           53m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1c   0         0                             53m
----

To create two new worker nodes, we will scale up the number of machines on two of these machinesets:
[source]
----
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=1 machinesets cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1c
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machinesets cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1b
----

Watch the machinesets until the `DESIRED` column matches the `AVAILABLE` column

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api -w
----
----
NAME                                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1a   1         1         1       1           59m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1b   2         2         2       2           59m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1c   1         1         1       1           59m
----

Next you can get some detailed information on your machines using this command:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api
----

At this point all machines should be in the `running` state. The `NAME` of your machines will be different than shown below.
You should see four workers now.

----
NAME                                                   STATE     TYPE         REGION         ZONE            AGE
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-master-0                     running   m4.xlarge    eu-central-1   eu-central-1a   62m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-master-1                     running   m4.xlarge    eu-central-1   eu-central-1b   62m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-master-2                     running   m4.xlarge    eu-central-1   eu-central-1c   62m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1a-zsfrs   running   m4.4xlarge   eu-central-1   eu-central-1a   60m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1b-cf27c   running   m4.4xlarge   eu-central-1   eu-central-1b   60m
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1b-px8p8   running   m4.4xlarge   eu-central-1   eu-central-1b   4m25s
cluster-berlin-4c88-lvb7p-worker-eu-central-1c-tt4lb   running   m4.4xlarge   eu-central-1   eu-central-1c   4m48s
----

You can see that the workers are provisioned using the instance type `m4.4xlarge`. This instance type comes with 16 vCPU and 64GB RAM. This is the recomended size for OCS installations.
More information on instance type specifications can be found in the link:https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[AWS documentation].

Now check to see that you have two new OCP worker nodes. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
----
NAME                                            STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION

----

=== Download Rook deployment files and install Ceph

In this section you will be using the new worker OCP nodes created in last section along with Rook image and configuration files. You will download files *common.yaml*, *operator-openshift.yaml*, *cluster.yaml* and *toolbox.yaml* to create Rook and Ceph resources as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above. 

First, validate that the 3 new OCP worker nodes are labeled with role=storage-node. This label was configured in each of the *machinesets* you used in last section so there is no need to manually add this label used for selecting OCP nodes for Rook deployment.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep storage-node
----

The first step to deploy Rook is to create the common resources. The configuration for these resources will be the same for most deployments. The *common.yaml* sets these resources up.

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4rook/common.yaml
oc create -f common.yaml
----

After the common resources are created, the next step is to create the Operator deployment using *operator-openshift.yaml*.  

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4rook/operator-openshift.yaml
oc create -f operator-openshift.yaml
watch oc get pods -n rook-ceph
----

Wait for all *rook-ceph-agent*, *rook-discover* and *rook-ceph-operator* pods to be in a `Running` STATUS. The log for the *rook-ceph-operator* pod should show that the operator is looking for a cluster. Look for `the server could not find the requested resource (get clusters.ceph.rook.io)` in the *rook-ceph-operator* log file. This means the operator is looking for a Ceph cluster that does not exist yet.

[source,role="execute"]
----
operator=$(oc get pod -l app=rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo $operator
oc logs $operator -n rook-ceph | grep "get clusters.ceph.rook.io"
----

Now that your operator resources are running, the next step is to create your Ceph storage cluster. This *cluster.yaml* file contains settings for a production Ceph storage cluster. The minimum deployment requires at least 3 OCP nodes. In this lab these will be the OCP nodes created earlier using the AWS EC2 `m5d.large` instance type each with an available 75GB NVMe SSD.

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4rook/cluster.yaml
----

Take a look at the *cluster.yaml* file. It specifies the version of Ceph and the label used for the rook resources. This label, `role=storage-node` was validated as being on our new OCP nodes at the beginning of this section. Also `useAllNodes=true` and `useAllDevices=true` means that if a OCP node has label `role=storage-node` then all available storage devices on this node will be used for the Ceph cluster.

[source,role="execute"]
----
cat cluster.yaml
----
[source,indent=10]
----
...
    image: ceph/ceph:v13.2.5-20190410

              operator: In
              values:

...

  storage: # cluster level storage configuration and selection
    useAllNodes: true
    useAllDevices: true
    deviceFilter:
    location:
    config:	
...	

----

Now create the Ceph resources.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f cluster.yaml
----

It may take more than 5 minutes to create all of the new *MONs*, *MGR* and *OSD* pods. The `NAME` of your pods will be different than shown below. 
*
[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n rook-ceph
----
----

rook-ceph-osd-prepare-ip-10-0-164-65-9wq67   0/2     Completed   0          90s
...

----

Once all pods are in a Running state it is time to verify that Ceph is operating correctly. Download *toolbox.yaml* to run Ceph commands.

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4rook/toolbox.yaml 
oc create -f toolbox.yaml
----

Now you can login to *rook-ceph-tools* pod to run Ceph commands. This pod is commonly called the *toolbox*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
toolbox=$(oc -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-tools" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox
----

Once logged into the *toolbox* use commands below to investigate the Ceph status and configuration. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd status
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd tree
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
rados df
----

Make sure to `exit` the *toolbox* before continuing. 

=== Create Rook storageclass for creating Ceph RBD volumes

In this section you will download *storageclass.yaml* and then create the OCP *storageclass* `rook-ceph-block` that can be used by applications to dynamically claim persistent volumes (*PVCs*). The Ceph pool `replicapool` is created when the OCP *storageclass* is created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/master/ocp4rook/storageclass.yaml
cat  storageclass.yaml
----

Notice the `provisioner: ceph.rook.io/block` and that `replicated: size=2` which is a good practice when there are only 3 OSDs. This is because if one *OSD* is down OCP volumes can continue to be created and used. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f storageclass.yaml
----

Login to *toolbox* pod to run Ceph commands. Compare results for `ceph df` and `rados df` executed in prior section before the new *storageclass* was created. You will see there is now a Ceph pool called `replicapool`. Also, the command `ceph osd pool ls detail` gives you information on how this pool is configured. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox

ceph df
rados df
rados -p replicapool ls
ceph osd pool ls detail
----

Make sure to `exit` the *toolbox* before continuing.

== Create new OCP deployment using Ceph RBD volume

In this section the `rook-ceph-block` *storageclass* will be used by an OCP application + database deployment to create persistent storage. The persistent storage will be a Ceph RBD (RADOS Block Device) volume (object) in the pool=`replicapool`.

Because the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment uses the `default` *storageclass* you need to modify the current default, gp2, and then make `rook-ceph-block` the default *storageclass*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc
----
----
NAME              PROVISIONER             AGE
gp2 (default)     kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   2d
rook-ceph-block   ceph.rook.io/block      8m27s
----

Now you want to change which *storageclass* is default. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit sc gp2
----

Remove this portion shown below from *storageclass* `gp2`. Make sure to note *EXACTLY* where this annotations is located in the *storageclass* (copying this portion to clipboard would be a good idea). The editing tool is `vi` when using *oc edit*. Make sure to save your changes before exiting `:wq!`.

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
----

Add the removed portion to `rook-ceph-block` in same place in the file so it will become the `default` *storageclass*. Make sure to save your changes before exiting `:wq!`. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit sc rook-ceph-block
----

After editing *storageclass* `rook-ceph-block` the result should be similar to below and `rook-ceph-block` should now be the `default` *storageclass*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc rook-ceph-block -o yaml
----
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  creationTimestamp: "2019-04-26T22:24:29Z"
  name: rook-ceph-block
...omitted...
----

Validate that `rook-ceph-block` is now the default *storageclass* before starting the OCP application deployment.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc
----
----
NAME                        PROVISIONER             AGE
gp2                         kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   2d1h
rook-ceph-block (default)   ceph.rook.io/block      10m32s
----

Now you are ready to start the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment and monitor the deployment. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-database-app
oc new-app rails-pgsql-persistent -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
----

After the deployment is started you can monitor with these commands.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc status
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
watch oc get pods -n my-database-app
----

This step could take 5 or more minutes. Wait until there are 2 pods in `Running` STATUS and 4 pods in `Completed` STATUS as shown below. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n my-database-app
----
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-1-deploy                 0/1     Completed   0          5m48s
postgresql-1-lf7qt                  1/1     Running     0          5m40s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-build      0/1     Completed   0          5m49s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-deploy     0/1     Completed   0          3m36s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-hook-pre   0/1     Completed   0          3m28s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-pjh6q      1/1     Running     0          3m14s
----

Once the deployment is complete you can now test the application and the persistent storage on Ceph. Your `HOST/PORT` will be different.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route -n my-database-app
----
----
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                                         PATH   SERVICES                 PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rails-pgsql-persistent   rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-a26e.sandbox449.opentlc.com          rails-pgsql-persistent
----

Copy your `HOST/PORT` to a browser window to create articles. You will need to append `/articles` to the end. 

*Example link:*  http://rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-a26e.sandbox449.opentlc.com /articles

Enter the `username` and `password` below to create articles and comments. The articles and comments are saved in a PostgreSQL database which stores its table spaces on the Ceph RBD volume provisioned using the `rook-ceph-block` *storagclass* during the application deployment.

[source,ini]
----
username: openshift
password: secret
----

Lets now take another look at the Ceph `replicapool` created by the `rook-ceph-block` *storageclass*. Log into the *toolbox* pod again.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox
----

Run the same Ceph commands as before the application deployment and compare to results in prior section. Notice the number of objects in `replicapool` now.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
rados df
rados -p replicapool ls | grep pvc
----

Make sure to `exit` the *toolbox*. Validate the OCP *PersistentVolume* (PV) name is the same name as the volume name in the Ceph `replicapool`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
----

== Using Rook to Upgrade Ceph

In this section you will upgrade the Ceph version from *Mimic* to *Nautilus* using the Rook operator. First verify the current version by logging into the *toolbox* pod.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox
ceph version
----

Make sure to `exit` the *toolbox* before continuing.

The result should be `ceph version 13.2.5 (cbff874f9007f1869bfd3821b7e33b2a6ffd4988) mimic (stable)`. 

The next thing you need to do is update the cluster CRD with a current *Nautilus* image name and version. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit cephcluster rook-ceph -n rook-ceph
----

Modify the Ceph version in the cluster CRD. Using `oc edit` is the same as using editing tool `vi`. 

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  cephVersion:
    image: ceph/ceph:v13.2.5-20190410
----

To the version for Nautilus. Make sure to save your changes before exiting `:wq!`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  cephVersion:
    image: ceph/ceph:v14.2.0-20190410
----

This could step take 5 minutes or more. Once the change to the Ceph version is edited as shown above, the *MONs*, *MGR*, and *OSD* pods will be restarted. You can tell that they have been restarted when their `AGE` is seconds or just a few minutes.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n rook-ceph

Now let's check the version of Ceph to see if it is upgraded. First you need to login to the *toolbox* pod again. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox
----

Running the `ceph versions` command shows each of the Ceph daemons (*MONs*, *MGR*, and *OSD*) have been upgraded to *Nautilus*. Run other Ceph commands to satisfy yourself (e.g., ceph status) the system is healthy after the Ceph upgrade from *Mimic* to *Nautilus*. You might even want to go back to the Rails + PostgreSQL application and save a few more articles to make sure Ceph storage is still working.

[source,role="execute"]

    "mon": {
        "ceph version 14.2.0 (3a54b2b6d167d4a2a19e003a705696d4fe619afc) nautilus (stable)": 3
    },
    "mgr": {
        "ceph version 14.2.0 (3a54b2b6d167d4a2a19e003a705696d4fe619afc) nautilus (stable)": 1

    }
}
----

Make sure to `exit` the *toolbox* before continuing.

You can also execute this command to easily look at both the Rook and Ceph versions currently running for the *MONs*, *MGR* and *OSDs*.

== Adding storage to the Ceph Cluster

In this section you will add more storage to the cluster by increasing the number of OCP workerocs *machines* and worker nodes from 3 to 4 using one of the *machinesets* you already used. The new *machine* will also be an EC2 instance `m5d.large` and have an available 75 GB NVMe SSD. The Rook operator will `observe` when the new OCP node is added to the cluster and will then create a new *OSD* pod on this new worker node and the 75 GB SSD will be added to the Ceph cluster with no additional manual effort from the user.

To increase the number of *machines* and the OCP nodes you will again use a *machineset*. Each of the *machinesets* you used earlier created just one machine because of `replicas: 1` in the configuration file. Your `cluster-api-cluster` and `name` is different than example shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
cat machineset cluster-workerocs-us-east-2a.yaml | more
----
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:

  name: cluster-a26e-rx8bk-workerocs-us-east-2a
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
...

----

Verify your `cluster-api-cluster` again by using the command below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
echo $CLUSTERID
----

You can easily create a new *machine* and OCP worker node in AWS AZ us-east-2a by just increasing the `replicas` count in one of the machinesets. Edit your machineset for us-east-2a to increase from `replicas: 1` to `replicas: 2`. Make sure to save your changes before exiting `:wq!`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit machineset $CLUSTERID-workerocs-us-east-2a -n openshift-machine-api
----

Verify you now have 4 workerocs *machines*. One of the *machines* should have just been created in us-east-2a AZ so there are two in this AZ now. The `NAME` of your *machines* will be different than shown below. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api
----
----

----

Now you need to verify that this new *machine* is added to the OCP cluster. 

This step could take more than 5 minutes. You can see now that one of the *machinesets* has 2 machines, this is because you increased the replica count in the prior step. The *machineset* for us-east-2a should have an integer, in this case `2`, filled out for the entire row before you proceed to the next step. The `NAME` of your machinesets will be different than shown below. 

[source,role="execute"]
----

cluster-a26e-rx8bk-workerocs-us-east-2b   1         1         1       1           2d

----

Now verify that you have a new OCP worker node. You should now have 7 worker nodes. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
----

Until Openshift Container Platform 4.2 rolls out, we will need to restart (delete) the operator pod to see OSD pod added.
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc delete pod -l app=rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph
----

This step could take 5 minutes or more for the forth *OSD* pod to be in a `Running` STATUS. Eventually your will see a new *OSD* pod, `rook-ceph-osd-3`, that has just been created.  

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n rook-ceph

...

----

Now you can validate that Ceph is healthy and has the additional storage. You again login to the *toolbox* pod.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n rook-ceph rsh $toolbox
----

And run Ceph commands to see the new OSDs.

[source,role="execute"]
----

And you can see that Ceph is healthy and happy! There are now 4 *OSDs* `up` and `in`. You might even want to go back to the the Rails + PostgreSQL application and save a few more articles to make sure applications using Ceph storage are still working.
